My 100 days of python challenge


This is literally what it says it is. 

Doing a 100 days of coding challenge to get my Python coding up to snuff and prepare myself for developer work. 

I am also saving it here/making it public to showcase some of the work I have done/will be doing (depending on when you read this). 

I have no issues with anyone using anything I post in this repository as long as it is being used for non-commercial purposes.
